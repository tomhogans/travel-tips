# General travel tips

Some of these tips are specific to US citizens, but most should apply more generally.  The sections are ordered by perceived importance.

## Identification

Your passport is the single most important item that you will keep with you when traveling.  It's not a particularly valuable target for theft (depending on location), losing it will be a very costly (time & money) detour for you.  Keep it in a secure location, do not bring it out anywhere unless absolutely necessary, and know the location of your nearest embassy or consulate that is able to issue a replacement should you need it.

##### Use photo copies whenever you can

Make 3-4 photo copies of your passport and driver's license.  Most commercial entities, such as hotels, tour operators, etc. will accept a photo copy of your passport.  They need the information on it, not the document itself.  It should be a very rare occasion that anyone needs your physical passport. 

##### Bring backup ID

Your driver's license, Global Entry card, or any other "official looking" ID should suffice in most cases.  As a foreigner you will not be asked for ID for most bars and nightclubs, but it's good to have something with your photo and birth date just in case.  If required by a bar, they most likely will not accept a photocopy.

## Cell phone

You won't realize how much you depend on your phone until you lose it in a foreign country.  Remember that even if you get another phone, you likely won't be able to get a SIM card for your domestic carrier and thus won't have access to your normal telephone number.  This can be extremely problematic for things like Google or online banking, that require two-factor authentication codes to be sent to your phone via SMS.

Check ahead of time if your carrier supports eSIM.  For example, Google Fi supports eSIM, meaning that you don't need to wait for a physical SIM card to configure a new phone with your number.  You can scan a QR code from the Google Fi web site to set up a new phone with Google Fi in another country.

##### Google Voice & two-factor authentication

Obtain a Google Voice number and use that as your two-factor phone number.  As long as you have access to your Google account you'll continue to have access to all of your other accounts.  You'll also be able to text and call from this number should you lose access to your primary number.

##### Use authenticator app and print backup codes

Whenever possible, use an authenticator app (I prefer LastPass Authenticator) instead of SMS two-factor auth.  Also keep a printed copy of your one-time backup codes for all your important accounts (Google, Facebook Messenger, Lastpass).

##### Backup phone

Buy a cheap Android phone and login to all your accounts before the trip.  This eliminates a lot of the potential two-factor frustration if you lose your primary phone and can't receive SMS messages on your primary number.

##### Preventing petty theft

If you're transiting a crowded area (especially public transportation), be mindful of pickpockets and thieves.  They usually work in groups of 2-4 people.  One or two people will distract you, another person will take your personal item(s) and immediately pass them to a different person who quickly leaves the area.  Even if you identify the person who took your item fairly quickly, they've likely already passed it to someone else.

You are an especially easy target when you're alone and/or carrying a lot of things.  Reduce your target area by not wearing baggy pants or shorts that are easy for someone else to reach into your pockets.  If you have a backpack, wear it forwards instead of backwards while you're walking through crowded spaces.  If people are bumping into you or artificially crowding you, keep your hands over the outside of your pockets to prevent people from reaching into them.
